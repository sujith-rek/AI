# 2. Bayesian Belief Networks: 10*4=40
# Problem Statement:
# You are given a dataset containing information about weather conditions (Temperature,
# Humidity, Wind, and Outlook) and whether people played tennis or not. Your task is to
# implement a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to predict whether people will play tennis based on
# the given weather conditions.
# Requirements:
# 1. Implement a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) from scratch using a programming language of
# your choice (e.g., Python, Java, etc.).
# 2. The BBN should consist of nodes representing the following variables: Temperature,
# Humidity, Wind, Outlook, and PlayTennis.
# 3. Use the dataset provided to learn the conditional probability tables (CPTs) for each node.
# 4. Implement the inference algorithm (e.g., Variable Elimination) to make predictions about
# whether people will play tennis given specific weather conditions.
# Dataset:
# | Outlook | Temperature | Humidity | Wind | PlayTennis |
# |---------|-------------|----------|------|------------|
# | Sunny | Hot | High | Weak | Yes |
# | Sunny | Hot | High | Strong | No |
# | Overcast | Hot | High | Weak | Yes |
# | Rain | Mild | High | Weak | Yes |
# | Rain | Cool | Normal | Weak | Yes |
# | Rain | Cool | Normal | Strong | No |
# | Overcast | Cool | Normal | Strong | Yes |
# | Sunny | Mild | High | Weak | No |
# | Sunny | Cool | Normal | Weak | Yes |
# | Rain | Mild | Normal | Weak | Yes |
# | Sunny | Mild | Normal | Strong | Yes |
# | Overcast | Mild | High | Strong | Yes |
# | Overcast | Hot | Normal | Weak | Yes |
# | Rain | Mild | High | Strong | No |
