# 3. Genetic Algorithms: 10*5=50
# Problem Statement:
# You are tasked with solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a genetic algorithm.
# Given a set of cities and their pairwise distances, your goal is to find the shortest possible route
# that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.
# Requirements:
# 1. Implement a genetic algorithm from scratch using a programming language of your choice.
# 2. Use a suitable representation (e.g., permutation encoding) to represent candidate solutions.
# 3. Define appropriate genetic operators (e.g., selection, crossover, mutation) for the TSP.
# 4. Implement the fitness function to evaluate the quality of each candidate solution.
# 5. Run the genetic algorithm for a specified number of generations and return the best solution
# found.
# Generate city maps of a few dozen cities and log the improvements over the generations
